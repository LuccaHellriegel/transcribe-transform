Record from your browser and immediately transform the transcript into something useful.

Local only. Nothing leaves the browser, except sending your API key and recording to OpenAI.

Ultra lazy version. Shocked that this does not exist.

Ideas:

- proper audio device choice
- download recording
- make recording-sessions differentiation and save stuff in indexedDB
- somehow make this easier to import in LogSeq
- dropdown for model types in transcription and transformation
- styling upgrade
- add council mode where multiple GPTs react to the transcript and the final GPT summarizes the reactions
